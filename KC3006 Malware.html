                <h2 id="Dist">Malware Distribution</h2>

                <h3 id="emails">Phishing Emails</h3>
                <P>Emails containing malware, either in an attachment or a link to a website created by the distributor.
                    the websites may download the malware onto the users computer or get the user to enter their
                    credentials for a site that they are imitating.
                </P> 

                <h3 id="rdp">Remote Desktop Protocol</h3>
                <P>Remote Desktop Protocol is a tool that can be used to control a computer using another computer,
                    and is commonly used by IT professionals to fix an issue on the system. However, if someone gains
                    access to it, they can install any program onto the system and access data.
                </P> 

                <h3 id="Social">Social Media Links</h3>
                <P>Links on social media are similar to emails in the fact that they are used to convince the user to
                    download something or visit a website that will download the malware. These can be posts from
                    strangers or from friend's who have had their account hacked.
                </P> 

            </div>
            <div class="Sec2">
                <h2 id="Mal_types">Types of Malware</h2>
                <h3 id="virus">Virus</h3>
                <P>Viruses are forms of malware that reproduce and spread itself. they require the user to run them in
                    some way, including .exe files, batch files and the operating system.
                </P> 

                <h3 id="Trojan">Trojan</h3>
                <P>A trojan is malware that tricks the user into thinking it is a legitimate file. The term comes from
                    the Greek story of a wooden horse being used to sneak into and attack from within a city. They grant
                    the distributor access to the victims system.
                </P> 

                <h3 id="Worm">Worm</h3>
                <P>Worms are similar to viruses in that they reproduce themselves, but the main difference is that worms
                    don't require the user to run a file. They spread through a network and infect any system that they
                    can. The main method of preventing them is firewall which block any unwanted connections
                </P> 

                <h3 id="Ransom">Ransomware</h3>
                <P>Ransomware is the blocking or stealing of data  
                    to force the victim to buy access back to it or to stop its 
                    publication
                </P> 

                <h3 id="Key">Keylogger</h3>
                <P>Keyloggers give the distributor the ability to see all the keys that the user is using and is mainly
                    used to find credentials and gain access to accounts or card details. Some can also gain access to
                    more data through screen capture software and clipboard logging
                </P>
