                <P>Encryption is the scrambling of data to obscure it to prevent anyone without authorisation from
                    reading it. the encrypted data appears random until the key is used to unscramble it. it can also
                    be used maliciously to lock someone out of their data or computer to demand a ransom from them. </P>

                <h3 id="Symmetric">Symmetric Encryption </h3>
                <P>Symmetric Encryption, also known as private key encryption, is when the Encryption and decryption
                    algorithm is the same. This was the only form of Encryption until Asymmetric was firs used int the
                    1970's. it is faster than Asymmetric encryption, so it is commonly used for large sets of data.
                    
                </P>    

                <h3 id="Asymmetric">Asymmetric Encryption</h3>
                <P>Asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, is when different keys are used to
                    encrypt and decrypt, the encryption key is usually publicly available.
                </P>    

                <h3 id="Hashing">Hashing</h3>
                <P>Hashing algorithms scrambles the data and produces an output that is difficult to unscramble.
                    It is used for content that doesn't need to be brought back to it's original state such as
                    passwords. The password is put through the algorithm and the output is stored, whenever the user
                    enters their password again, it is run through the algorithm and the outputs are compared.
